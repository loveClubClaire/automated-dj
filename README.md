# Automated DJ

The Automated DJ is a tool for scheduled playlist generation programmed in Swift 3 for macOS. The Automated DJ is a lightweight, easy to use tool which allows for the scheduled generation of playlists on a weekly basis. Users are able to customize the content of each generated playlist, without needing to painstakingly create playlists manually. Designed with Internet Radio in mind, the Automated DJ allows for a small, independent broadcaster to produce a consistent and professional quality broadcast with minimal resources! The Automated DJ utilizes iTunes for storing and playing music, so there is no need to learn about or configure a new media player.
